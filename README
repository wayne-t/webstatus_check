This project is to:
1. Create a webpage to let user check whether a webpage is up or not.
2. Deploy '1' on a web host

Notes:
The deployment I did on OpenShift last weekend was straightforward: git client on my PC, commit and push to the webhost's folder(which is the git server folder as well), then deployment is done.
What I wanted was a bit more advanced: when I commit and push to github(not OpenShift), the hook I set on github will trigger deploy.php located on webhost(such as OpenShift) already. That php will then pull from Github to that webpage to complete an "auto deploy". Only this way, a "deply script" is used and the webhost doesn't have to be a git server. Unfortunately, free webhost doesn't support mechanism for this kind of setup(needs to install git and clone to the server side first). But I am able to run that deploy.php on my local webhost and pull from github automatically. It means, for a deployment that is using web hosting supporting the setup, my deployment script will work fine! I will demo it.
